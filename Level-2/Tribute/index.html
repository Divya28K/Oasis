      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869–1948), known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the leader of India’s
        non-violent independence movement against British rule. His philosophy of <em>Ahimsa</em> (non-violence)
        and <em>Satyagraha</em> (truth and firmness) inspired millions across the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
      <p>
        Gandhi’s life teaches us the power of simplicity, truth, and self-discipline. His words and actions continue
        to inspire people to stand for justice, peace, and equality without hatred or violence.
      </p>
